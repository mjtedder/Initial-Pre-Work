<!-- SUMMARY STATEMENT -->

<!-- This lesson explained how to create an unordered list.  This will render
as a bulleted list on the browser.  Start with an opening <ul> tag, then nest as many
<li> tags as you'd like to have bullet points.  Finally, close the unordered list with a closing </ul> tag. -->
