<!-- SUMMARY STATEMENT -->

<!-- This lesson explained how to nest anchor elements within a paragraph element.  To do so,
simply add a <p> tag, include your text, and then add the anchor element like you normally would,
    with a href attribute with a value containing the URL of the destination page.  It is also advisable
    to add a target attribute with the value "_blank" to make sure when the link is clicked it opens a
    new tab.  This minimizes traffic diversion from your web site.  Close the anchor element with an </a> tag
    and continue adding text to your paragraph, then close it with a </p> tag. -->
