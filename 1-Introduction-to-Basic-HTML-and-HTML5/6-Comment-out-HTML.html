<!-- SUMMARY STATEMENT -->

<!-- In this exercise I learned how to comment out certain parts of my code that I don't want to render to the browser.
I commented out the <h1> and <p> tags so that only the subheading CatPhotoApp would be displayed.
-->


<!-- <h1>Hello World</h1> -->

<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!-- <p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
