<!-- SUMMARY STATEMENT -->

<!-- This lesson explained the use of dead links and how to apply them.  Dead links are a value applied
to the href attribute of the anchor element when the developer wants to insert a link to their web site but
doesn't have a destination for the link at the present moment.  Dead links are also useful when a developer wants to change the behavior of a link
using JavaScript. -->
