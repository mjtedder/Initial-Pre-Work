<!-- SUMMARY STATEMENT -->

<!-- This lesson explained the importance of including a <!DOCTYPE html> tag at the top of an html file.  This is used to structure EVERY html document on the web.  It tells the browser which version of HTML is being used.  This particular doctype denotes that HTML5 will follow on the page.  The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important for older browsers that render the file.  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<h1>HTML5 Document Here</h1>
