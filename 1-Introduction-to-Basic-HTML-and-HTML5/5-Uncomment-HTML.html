<!-- SUMMARY STATEMENT -->

<!-- This lesson taught me about commenting out HTML code.  When using comments the code will not be displayed to the user on the browser, only to someone working on the project in an IDE.  We do this to explain to other developers or our future selves what the code is doing.  This saves precious time down the road when additional features need to be added to the application. -->
