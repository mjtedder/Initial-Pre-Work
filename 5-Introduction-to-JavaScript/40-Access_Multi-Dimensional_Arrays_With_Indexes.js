/*

We can use bracket notation to access multi-dimensional arrays.  To do this, we use multiple brackets.
The first set of brackets refers to the first level of the array, and the following brackets refers to the next
level of entries inside the array.

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
