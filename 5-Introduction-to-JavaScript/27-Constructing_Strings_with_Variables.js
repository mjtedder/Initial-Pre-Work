/*

We can construct strings by saving it to a variable, and then concatenating that variable onto a string.
This is useful when we want to insert more than one variable into a string.

*/

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Matt";
var myStr = "My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
