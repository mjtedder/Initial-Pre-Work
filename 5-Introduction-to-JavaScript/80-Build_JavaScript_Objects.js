/*

Here we built a simple JavaScript object.  It's similar to an array, but the data is accessed and modified through
properties.  Objects are useful for storing data that exists in the real world.  We can store properties in an object
as strings or numbers, and these property values can be any JavaScript data type.

// Example
var ourDog = {
    "name": "Camper",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.
var myDog = {
    "name": "Madonna",
    "legs": 4,
    "tails": 1,
    "friends": ["Salem", "Luna"]
};
