/*

In JavaScript, string values are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once created.  Even if we want to
alter one character in a string, we have to completed reassign it as such:

var string = "Hoodbye World";

string = "Goodbye World";

*/

// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line

myStr = "Hello World"; // Fix Me
