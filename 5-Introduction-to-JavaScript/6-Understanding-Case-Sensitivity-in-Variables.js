/*
In JavaScript, it is best practice to use what is called camelCase when declaring variables.  This involves having the
first word of the variable lower-case and the subsequent words upper-case.

var camelCase = "This is camelCase".

// Declarations
var studlyCapVar;
var properCamelCase;
var titleCaseOver;

// Assignments
studlyCapVar = 10;
properCamelCase = "A String";
titleCaseOver = 9000;
