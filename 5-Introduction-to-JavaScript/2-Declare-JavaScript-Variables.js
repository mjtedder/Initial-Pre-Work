/* JavaScript seven different data types which can be stored in a variable.  To create a variable, we use the keyword "var"
then the name of the variable.  We also end the statement with a semicolon, but when ES6 was introduced this is no longer necessary
for the code to run.  Since we are practicing basic JavaScript in this module, we will end all statements with a semicolon.

*/

// Example
var ourName;

// Declare myName below this line
var myName;
