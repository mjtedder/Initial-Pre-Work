/*

The assignment operator allows us to store one of the 7 data types as a value in a JavaScript variable.  Assignment
goes from right to left.  So everything to the right of the assignment operator (=) is assigned to the variable to the left
of the assignment operator (=).  We can also reassign variable values once they're declared using the assignment
operator.  On line 16 we reassigned the variable b to be equal to the value of the variable a (7).

*/

// Setup
var a;
var b = 2;

// Only change code below this line
a = 7;
b = a;
