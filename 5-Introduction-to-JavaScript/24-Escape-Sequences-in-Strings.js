/*

We can escape other characters within strings in JavaScript.  This has personally
proved useful for me when I work in the terminal in node.JS.  For example, the
variable myStr would print like this:

FirstLine
    \SecondLine
ThirdLine   

*/

var myStr = "FirstLine\n\t\\SecondLine\nThirdLine\t"
