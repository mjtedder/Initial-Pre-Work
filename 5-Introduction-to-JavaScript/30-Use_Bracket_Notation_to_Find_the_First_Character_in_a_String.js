/*

We can use bracket notation to find the index location of a character in a string.  It's important
to remember that JavaScript starts counting at 0, unlike humans who start at 1.  This is called zero-based
indexing.  So, to find the first character in a string variable in bracket notation we would use myVar[0].

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
