/* This lesson explained the importance of comments in code.  Comments are used to explain what the code is doing.  This is good
when you want to come back to a project and add updates, the code will remind you of what the functions do and the functionality
you have created so far.

Comments are also great when you are working on a team and a future developer is assigned to a project you worked on previously.
It tells them what has been done so far.
