/*

In this lesson, we created a variable called myList that contained a multi-dimensional array with 5
sub-arrays, each with a string of the item for a shopping list, and then an integer representing the quantity of that
item we need.

var myList = [["Ramen", 12],["Cola", 4],["Gelato", 7],["Eggs", 14],["Salmon", 2]];
