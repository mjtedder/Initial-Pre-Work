/*

When we use the + operator between two strings, it will concatenate, or combine them.  For example:

var fullName = "Matthew" + " Tedder";

This will print as Matthew Tedder.  Be sure to include spaces when concatenating srings.

*/

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end.";
