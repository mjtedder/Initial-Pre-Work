/*

We can use the augmented addition (+=) operator to both assign a value to a variable and perform addition
on that variable.  In the example below:

a will return 15 because on line 19 we are telling it to be assigned the value of a + 12.  a is initialized with
a value of 3 on line 13, so 3 + 12 = 15. So  a = 15.

*/



var a = 3;
var b = 17;
var c = 12;

// Only modify code below this line

a += 12;
b += 9;
c += 7;
