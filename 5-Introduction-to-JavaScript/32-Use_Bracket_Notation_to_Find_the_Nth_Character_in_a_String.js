/*

We can also use bracket notation to find other characters in a string.  Just remember that 0 is used to start counting
characters, so if we want to find the first character in a string we would use, myStr[0] to access the first character.

*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
