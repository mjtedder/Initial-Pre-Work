/*
The remainder (%) operator is used to give the remainder of the division between two numbers.

In the example below:

11 % 3 = 2 because
Math.floor(11 / 3) = 3 (quotient)
3 * 3 = 9
11 - 9 = 2 (Remainder)

We can also use the remainder (%) operator to check whether a number is even or odd by checking the
remainder of the division of the number by 2.

// Only change code below this line

var remainder = 11 % 3;
