/*

We can also use the += operator to concatenate strings.  On line 14 myStr will print:

This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence.

Always remember to include your own spaces when concatenating strings.

*/

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line

var myStr = "This is the first sentence. ";
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
