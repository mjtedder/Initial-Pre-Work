/* Flex-shrink is a property we can apply to the children flex items of a  parent flex container.
This allows items to shrink if their parent container is smaller than the combined widths of all flex items
within it.  This is great for preventing overlfow of items from a container.

To apply flex-shrink to a flex item, you specify flex-shrink and it takes a value of a number.  The higher
the number, the more it will shrink compared to other items in the container.  Notice that we applied a
flex-shrink value of 1 to box-1, and 2 to box-2, this means that box-2 will appear smaller within the container. */
